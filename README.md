How to even nuke a server?

    1. Your bot is ready for nukes
    
    2. You just need to open a file called: nuke_bot
    
    3. When your program starts, you will see a nuke bot sign
    
    4. Below the caption is also an invite link for the nuke bot
    
    5. When you invite a bot, the bot must be online and the program must be open
    
    6. When you make sure everything works, send #play to the channel
    
    7. The bot starts deleting and spamming, but if you want to stop it, write #stop and the bot stops!
